\section{Data separation}
Overall, the process of moving data from CIMS into the an archive database was pain free. Both mongodb and elasticsearch proved capable of quickly inserting a CIMS instance with several years worth of data. 

\section{Query support}
Translating queries to the query languages of mongodb and elasticsearch was a challenge.
Fewer joins are made with the non-relational model, which is good because joins in an distributed environment is really expensive \cite{Catell}. Joins made on application is better for the database, because the "join" is made on the webserver and not in the database server.

Elasticsearch has a very rich query system where the same query can be represented in many different ways. Chosing the correct way to represent a query can impact results in terms of performance and dependability of results.
