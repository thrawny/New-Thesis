In this chapter we discuss the evaluation results of the developed artifacts and relate these to our research questions.

\section{RQ2 - Management of historical data}
The concept of polyglot persistence and the literature on this subject provided much benefit in terms of addressing the problem at hand. As a solution to this problem, the goal of physically separating the complete data set into two parts, one for live data and one for historical data, was the first step to designing a system that is much more efficient. Achieving this goal enables many things. 

- Keeping live data in a relational database is highly beneficial if the size of live data is small. \\
- Accessing historical data has no effect on performance of the database with the live data. \\
- Possibility to have different solutions for live and historical data. \\
