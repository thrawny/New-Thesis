\chapter{Domain}
\label{chap:domain}

This chapter begins with an high level description of the domain. This is followed by a description of the schema in the relational database of CIMS and its use cases.

\section{High level schema}
The domain in which CIMS operates has the following high level entities; products, revisions, builds, test suites, test cases and trouble reports. Excluding trouble reports, these entities form a hierarchical structure as seen in figure~\ref{fig:er}. Products are at the top of this hierarchy. They represent the different software systems that are being developed at Ericsson. Products are developed iteratively, where each released iteration is called a revision. At the revision level, developers makes changes to source code, configuration, tests etc.\ which are then checked into a revision control system and subsequently built and tested. This is referred to in domain terms as a build. Each build runs a number of test suites, which in turn consist of a number test cases.

As has been noted, a trouble report sits outside of the hierarchy. This entity represents a bug or defect which arrives from external (i.e.\ a customer) or internal sources. It can be mapped to different entities from products down to specific test cases. Trouble reports are handled by implementing a fix in a specific build.

\section{Existing relational implementation}
The relational database schema in use by CIMS represents the above mentioned entities in a different abstraction. Representation of these entities are described in depth in the sections below. 
The schema of the relational database in CIMS is presented in figure~\ref{fig:sql}.

\label{fig:job}
\end{figure}
The top level entity of a test suite is represented by the job table. A job is used to group related job events and thereby form a test suite. A test suite is run within a build, as seen in figure~\ref{fig:job}, a job belongs to a build via the 'build job mapping' table.

\end{figure}
In the relational database, a build is represented by the build table. Each build can posses a number of artifacts and deliverable\_events, as seen in figure~\ref{fig:build}. An artifact can be whatever we want...

\hiddensubsection{Get test case history}
\label{q:tchistory}
Query in CIMS: Get event history \\
SQL: This query cannot be expressed as a single SQL statement and is implemented on the application level in CIMS by performing several SQL queries and building a dictionary with the results. Psuedo code for query:
\begin{verbatim}
job_events = SELECT * FROM cims_job_event WHERE name = 'some_name'
job_names = job_event.job_name FOR job_event IN job_events // List comprehension

jobs = SELECT * FROM cims_job WHERE job_name IN job_names
root_job_event_ids = job.root_jobevent_id FOR job IN jobs // List comprehension
root_job_events = SELECT * FROM job_event WHERE id IN root_job_event_ids

builds = 
    SELECT cims_build.* FROM cims_build
    INNER JOIN cims_build_job_mapping
    ON cims_build_job_mapping.build_id = cims_build.id
    WHERE cims_build_job_mapping.job_name IN job_names

(Use list of job_events, jobs, root job events and builds to create result dictionary)

\end{verbatim}
Example input: {\tt tc\_48\_027\_handover\_roaming\_restricted } \\
Example output: \\
This query should return the history of a test case, identified by its name, filtered optionally by extra parameters. It should group the results by product and for each of these show the builds containing the specific test case and the verdict of the test case in that build.

%\hiddensubsection{Get test tree}
%\label{q:gettesttree}
%Query in CIMS: Get job tree by id or job name \\
%SQL: This query cannot be performed with a single SQL statement. The tree structure is built on the application level. Pseudo code:
%\begin{verbatim}
%job_events = SELECT * FROM cims_job_event WHERE job_name = 'some_name'
%create_tree_structure(job_events) // Recursive function
%\end{verbatim}
%Example input: $1234567$\\
%Example output: \\
%In the relational data model of CIMS, a job represents a root test suite for a specific build. I.e a test suite with no parent. This query should, given a unique id of such a job, return the hierarchical representation of that job.


\hiddensubsection{Get all build data}
\label{q:getallbuilddata}
Query in CIMS: na \\
SQL: This specific query is not expressed as a single SQL statement. Pseudo code:
\begin{verbatim}
build = SELECT * FROM cims_build WHERE id = 'some_id'

jobs = 
    SELECT cims_job.* FROM cims_job
    INNER JOIN cims_build_job_mapping
    ON cims_build_job_mapping = cims_build_job_mapping.job_name = job.job_name
    WHERE cims_build_job_mapping.build_id = build.id // same id as previous query
job_names = job.name FOR job IN jobs // list comprehension

job_events = SELECT * FROM cims_job_event WHERE job_name IN job_names
\end{verbatim}
Example input: {\tt CXS101289\_LLVDRAGON\_MKX\_SPRINT3\_R1A03\_140605084139 } \\
Example output: \\
This query should retrieve the complete view of a uniquely identified build. This means all the build information plus all related test suites and test cases.

%\section{Architecture of CIMS}

%CIMS has a multitier architecture as seen in figure X. Whenever a build is started, data from multiple sources is collected and sent to the system. This data is transformed to fit into the relational data model of CIMS.
%
%Presentation of data is done in real time via a web application. In order to support this, CIMS employs a number technologies in support of the main relational database, effectively forming a polyglot persistence solution. This includes a search engine (Sphinx) for aggregation of test cases, and a key value store (Redis) for caching.
%
%An external REST API is exposed to gather data for other purposes than real time visualization.
