\section*{Abstract}
This master's thesis reports on the design and evaluation of two different prototypes for management of historical data in a continuous integration system at Ericsson. Continuous integration is an agile software practise where code is checked in frequently and subsequently built and tested automatically. Due the increasing maturity of this practise at Ericsson, the frequency of these builds is increasing and as such much more data about the development process is generated. The constructed prototypes where designed specifically to address problems related to scalability and performance of the current continuous integration systems in use at the company. Evaluation shows that the prototypes solves scalability problems and increases performance of current systems by separating live from stale data. The value of the prototypes is further motivated by investigating how historical data in a continuous integration system can be utilized for the benefit of the company.
